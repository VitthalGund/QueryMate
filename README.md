## Project Synopsis :

#### BACKGROUND :

In a world overwhelmed with information, finding precise and accurate answers efficiently is crucial. While doing research work, we often use resources like documents containing an abundance of lengthy information, official documentations, technical blogs, e-books, etc. to get a relevant answer for the questions from a particular data source. We, as learners, are usually recommended to read reference books for our academic subjects, which is good. However, there are times when we want quick and accurate answers. Even for that purpose, we have to thoroughly analyze the entire book which contains a bit of lengthy content. This work is very time-consuming, and it drains our energy in reading irrelevant information.

#### ABSTRACT :

QueryMate is a tool that centers on developing an intelligent Question and Answering (Q&A) System that draws strength from custom dataset, revolutionizing the way users access and comprehend information. By training our model on carefully curated data, we aim to develop a solution that can understand context, extract relevant information, and accurate responses to user queries. The motivation behind this project stems from the ever-growing challenge of efficiently navigating to find information quickly in the huge amount of data. In a world where information is abundant but not always easily accessible, our tool can streamline the process of finding accurate and relevant answers to queries. Traditional keyword-based searches often fall short when it comes to understanding delicate queries or providing concise and relevant answers. We are doing this project because it’s getting harder to find what we’re looking for in all the information available. Regular searches don’t always understand our questions well or give us the right answers. So, we’re creating a sophisticated yet smart Q&A Tool using a special set of data to help fix this problem. Our project aims to bridge this gap by embracing the latest advancements in AI and NLP. Students and Learners can utilize this tool to get technical answers from their reference books. General users can save time by just doing a simple copy-paste and getting their query resolved. This will also help the Analysts and Researchers to get their insights from their data.
