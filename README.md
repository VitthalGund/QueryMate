## üìë Project Synopsis :

#### BACKGROUND :

In a world overwhelmed with information, finding precise and accurate answers efficiently is crucial. While doing research work, we often use resources like documents containing an abundance of lengthy information, official documentations, technical blogs, e-books, etc. to get a relevant answer for the questions from a particular data source. We, as learners, are usually recommended to read reference books for our academic subjects, which is good. However, there are times when we want quick and accurate answers. Even for that purpose, we have to thoroughly analyze the entire book which contains a bit of lengthy content. This work is very time-consuming, and it drains our energy in reading irrelevant information.

#### ABSTRACT :

QueryMate is a tool that centers on developing an intelligent Question and Answering (Q&A) System that draws strength from custom dataset, revolutionizing the way users access and comprehend information. By training our model on carefully curated data, we aim to develop a solution that can understand context, extract relevant information, and accurate responses to user queries. The motivation behind this project stems from the ever-growing challenge of efficiently navigating to find information quickly in the huge amount of data. In a world where information is abundant but not always easily accessible, our tool can streamline the process of finding accurate and relevant answers to queries. Traditional keyword-based searches often fall short when it comes to understanding delicate queries or providing concise and relevant answers. We are doing this project because it‚Äôs getting harder to find what we‚Äôre looking for in all the information available. Regular searches don‚Äôt always understand our questions well or give us the right answers. So, we‚Äôre creating a sophisticated yet smart Q&A Tool using a special set of data to help fix this problem. Our project aims to bridge this gap by embracing the latest advancements in AI and NLP. Students and Learners can utilize this tool to get technical answers from their reference books. General users can save time by just doing a simple copy-paste and getting their query resolved. This will also help the Analysts and Researchers to get their insights from their data.

üí¨ PROJECT IDEA DISCUSSION AND DRAFTING OF SYNOPSIS

  + Every team member has explored and actively contributed in examining and suggesting different project ideas.
  + We settled on five project ideas before presenting them to our project mentor, Rupali ma'am.
  + In a meeting, we presented our ideas to Rupali ma'am. She approved three out of the five ideas, providing us with explanations for selecting these three and her reasons for disapproving the other two.
  + In the end, we opted for QueryMate because we deemed it more practical, useful and valuable.

üîç EXPLORING PROJECT REQUIREMENTS

+ We conducted a thorough review of prior work in this related field, if any has been undertaken.
+ We began identifying and selecting further objectives that have the potential to greatly enhance the existing project's overall value and impact.
+ We found it imperative to acquire datasets for training our models, enabling us to accurately predict the desired outputs.
+ We agreed on utilizing ``Google BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)`` and ```Google USE (Universal Sentence Encoder)```, while also considering the need for ``Facebook RoBERTa (Robustly Optimized BERT Pre-Training Approach)`` if any challenges arise with ``Google BERT``
+ Taking into account the team's proficiency, we selected the following deep learning technologies:
    + ``NLP (Natural Language Processing)`` techniques, including ``RNN (Recurrent Neural Networks)`` and ``LSTM (Long Short Term Memory)``
    + ``TensorFlow`` framework for robust model training.
+  Overall, we chosed the technology stack for both the frontend and the backend of the project, with the committment to concurrently learn and master these technologies during the developmental phase:
    + Frontend: ``ReactJS``
    + Backend: ``NodeJS``

üé® DEVELOPMENT KICK-OFF BY DESIGNING USER INTERFACE AND WIREFRAMES

+ We dedicated our time for designing the system architecture, user interface (UI) and creating wireframes that outline the visual structure and flow of application.
+ This included crafting visually appealing and user-friendly layouts, color schemes, and interactive elements that enhance the overall user experience.
+ Additionally, we meticukously created wireframes, which are detailed blueprints of the user interface. These wireframes will serve as the visual foundation for our application, helping us plan the arrangement of elements and userflow.
+ Throughout this week, we encouraged iterative design and feedback from team members to ensure that the UI aligns with project goals and user expectations.
+ Now, we have a well-thought-out design before we start coding.
